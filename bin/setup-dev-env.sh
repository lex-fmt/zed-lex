# setup-dev-env.sh — Layer 0 bootstrap, installed and managed by `shipit install`.
#
# The managed set owns the consumer ENVIRONMENT (pixi envs, pinned linters,
# issue #547), but everything above rides pixi — and the ADR-0033 pinned
# `bin/shipit` launcher rides uv (`uv tool run` resolves the repo's pin). This
# script provisions that base system: it reconciles pixi and uv TO THEIR PINS
# (reconcile-to-pin, never install-if-missing — a drifted version is reconciled
# exactly like an absent one) from sha256-verified GitHub release tarballs into
# ~/.local/bin, then best-effort pre-solves the repo's pixi environments.
#
# Idempotent and cheap when converged: two version probes plus a locked solve
# that no-ops. LOUD and fail-open on every miss (`setup-dev-env:` warnings on
# stderr, exit 0): it runs from the managed SessionStart hook and must never
# brick a session — a warned, degraded session beats no session. The one
# hard-failing consumer of this script is docker/verify-self-provision.sh,
# which asserts the pins landed.
#
# Release tarballs, never `curl | sh` vendor installers: the Claude Code cloud
# sandbox's default "Trusted" egress allowlist carries github.com and
# release-assets.githubusercontent.com but NOT pixi.sh / astral.sh, so the
# pinned, checksum-verified release asset is the one fetch path that works
# identically on a laptop, in docker, and in a cloud session.
#
# Do not edit — `shipit install` overwrites this file.
