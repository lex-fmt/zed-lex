# --- 2.5. Chromium NSS DB cert import ------------------------------------
# Cloud sessions route HTTPS through an "Anthropic sandbox-egress…CA"
# proxy that re-signs every leaf cert. Chromium on Linux ignores the
# OpenSSL bundle and reads its own NSS DB at ~/.pki/nssdb — without
# the CA imported there, every HTTPS resource an Electron / Playwright
# test loads is rejected with ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID. The e2e
# harness's runtime-error fixture surfaces that as a `console.error`
# and the test auto-fails.
#
# Cert layouts seen in the cloud env (probe both):
#   (A) Historical (~pre-2026-05): the sandbox-egress CA was
#       concatenated into the system bundle
#       /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt alongside public roots.
#   (B) Current (2026-05+): the CA ships as standalone PEMs at
#       /etc/ssl/certs/swp-ca-{production,staging}.pem; it is NOT
#       written into the system bundle, so the old layout-A grep gate
#       silently misses it and the NSS DB is never populated. `curl`
#       and Node still work because they read the bundle directly via
#       their own paths — only Chromium / Electron is affected.
#
# Strategy: collect candidate PEMs from both layouts into a scratch
# dir, then run the subject-match-and-import loop over the union.
# Fast-path: skip everything if neither layout has any matching cert
# (non-cloud Linux box). Idempotent — `certutil -L -n <nick>` short-
# circuits the `-A` import once a cert is present.
#
# Gated on `certutil` AND `openssl` existing (the loop forks openssl
# per cert to extract the subject); both are env-level state on cloud
# sessions but may be absent locally.
